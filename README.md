# RPi_Pico_BigNumbers_LCD_I2C
Converted Arduino LCD BigNumber to Pico C solution

This repository is just a test of using BigNumbers on a solution using RPi Pico and a LCD1602 display.

The code was used on a small project where the Pico ha a 2.4GHz radio module attached to UART0.

Another module was installed on a Rpi 4 sending information to the Pico (time, weather data, power usage etc).

I might load up all the code at a later time....

The radio module used is based on the XN297LCU chip.
